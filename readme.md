# Awesome WM Tag Switcher Polybar Module
This is a module for polybar that adds a sort of a tag-list switcher to your polybar.

**Important Note**: In order for this module to function correctly, Awesome WM must be using the standard modkey (Mod4/Left Super), and the default keyboard shortcuts for switching between the tags: Super_L+#1-9. If you don't use the standard key-bindings, you'll have to make some changes to the polybar module to get this working properly.

## Dependencies
* [Awesome WM](https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome)
* [Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar)
* [``xdotool``](https://github.com/jordansissel/xdotool), is the thing that actually makes this work. I think I can safely assume everyone interested already has Awesome & Polybar installed.

### Additional tools that might be handy
* [Gnome Character Map](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Apps/Gucharmap?action=show&redirect=Gucharmap), ``gucharmap``, for finding custom icons.
* [``xev``](https://www.commandlinux.com/man-page/man1/xev.1.html), if you use alternate keyboard shortcuts and need to do additional configuration.

## Usage
Simply add the following to your polybar modules list, in whatever position and/or order you prefer. Options are ``modules-left``, ``modules-center``, or ``modules-right``. I keep mine in the center.

``1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9``

Then at the bottom of your polybar config, paste in the following new modules:
```
[module/1]
type = custom/script
exec = echo "1"
click-left = "xdotool key --clearmodifiers Super_L+1"
[module/2]
type = custom/script
exec = echo "2"
click-left = "xdotool key --clearmodifiers Super_L+2"
[module/3]
type = custom/script
exec = echo "3"
click-left = "xdotool key --clearmodifiers Super_L+3"
[module/4]
type = custom/script
exec = echo "4"
click-left = "xdotool key --clearmodifiers Super_L+4"
[module/5]
type = custom/script
exec = echo "5"
click-left = "xdotool key --clearmodifiers Super_L+5"
[module/6]
type = custom/script
exec = echo "6"
click-left = "xdotool key --clearmodifiers Super_L+6"
[module/7]
type = custom/script
exec = echo "7"
click-left = "xdotool key --clearmodifiers Super_L+7"
[module/8]
type = custom/script
exec = echo "8"
click-left = "xdotool key --clearmodifiers Super_L+8"
[module/9]
type = custom/script
exec = echo "9"
click-left = "xdotool key --clearmodifiers Super_L+9"
```
A sample polybar config with the modules in work can be viewed [here](https://github.com/makccr/dot/blob/bc16321907a06fcfcbec530cea4956945ed90ad2/.config/polybar/config).

### Customization
By default the module will exist as a line of numbers on your bar that will switch tags on click. In order to customize the icons displayed in the bar, you need to change the output for each of the nine modules. For example, changing ``exec = echo "1"`` to ``exec = echo "â€¢"``, will display a neat, non-numbered row of dots on the bar that have the same functionality; not dissimilar to the sample image provided in this readme.

Additionally, you can use the [``gucharmap``](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Apps/Gucharmap?action=show&redirect=Gucharmap) program to find a more extensive selection of icons to use in tandem with this module.

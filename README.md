# Awesome WM Tag Switcher Polybar Module
This is a module for polybar that adds a sort of a tag-list switcher to your polybar.

**Important Note**: In order for this module to function correctly, Awesome WM must be using the standard modkey (Mod4/Left Super), and the default keyboard shortcuts for switching between the tags: Super_L+1-9.

## Dependecies
* Awesome WM
* Polybar
* ``xdotool``, is the thing that actually makes this work. I think I can safely assume everyone interested already has Awesome & Polybar installed.
